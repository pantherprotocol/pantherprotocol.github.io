##Progressive decentralization

When initially launching permissionless protocols, developers should seek to gradually
remove themselves as intermediaries. This permits fixing bugs quickly in a production
environment. This also facilitates rapid product iteration and evolution. Panther will be
launched in incremental stages with increasing functionality being added over time towards
full decentralization.

###Phase 1 - Ethereum Panther

In the first phase of development, zAssets are minted and burned by Panther Users through an
Ethereum based Panther Vault which forms part of Ethereum Panther. Ethereum has been
chosen for the first deployment as it is a highly composable and liquid DeFi protocol and is
the ideal mechanism for proving protocol robustness, adoption and effectiveness of Panther
Pools. Initially, the Panther treasury will be managed by the Panther Foundation, however,
Phase 1 will see the migration of these funds over to the control of the community governed
Panther DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) (Buterin), which will also be
deployed on Ethereum. The Panther DAO will be responsible for setting privacy miner
rewards, mint and burn fees, bug bounties, education and software development grants.

###Phase 2 - Panther Protocol

In the second phase of development, the Panther Protocol will be built and launched
following a public sale of Panther tokens. Envisioned as a decentralized custodian enabling
the minting and burning of zAssets across any peerchain, Panther protocol will extend the
utility of Panther to multiple blockchains and brings with it a number of advantages:
1. End to end private smart contract execution;
2. Aligned governance incentives from Panther Token holders to the Panther Protocol
vs. any one Panther peerchain deployments;
3. Solving scaling problems that come with peerchain-to-peerchain direct bridges,
enabling seamless, interoperability between peerchains;
4. Optimized blockchain designed for censorship resistance decentralized custody using
51% censorship resistant Ouroboros consensus.

###Phase 3 - Panther on Multiple Peerchains

In the third phase of development Pantherâ€™s decentralized community of developers will be
focused on interoperability between chains and the building out of a private DeFi ecosystem,
all of which will be governed by Panther Token holders and funded through the Panther
DAO. With the core Panther Protocol responsible for managing one of the private keys for
Panther Vaults on each peerchain, and supporting turing complete, private smart contracts,
there will be an emergence of new Panther deployments on other peerchains to enable
privacy on and between these growing ecosystems.
