##Panther DAO

Governance, being central to the success of the Panther ecosystem, will be initially managed
by the independently run Panther Foundation which will be responsible for treasury
management. Once the Panther DAO is launched, all the Panther Tokens held by Panther
Foundation will be transferred and Panther Token holders will take over treasury
management, token economics and funding PIPs by way of a quadratic voting system
(Buterin) based on the Panther Token holder balances. Voting will be done in a completely
transparent way through a public portal.

Panther Token holders can vote on specific budgets and projects to be funded, such as new
peerchain Panther deployments, and play a critical role in the direction the protocol is going.
Functioning like a decentralized crowdfunding platform, the budget can be used for anything
that creates value within the ecosystem.
