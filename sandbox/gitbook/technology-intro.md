##How It Works

The different stakeholders involved in the Panther ecosystem include:

- Gatekeepers responsible for verifying Users and custodying collateral in Panther
Vaults. Gatekeepers are the exclusive minters and burners of zAssets and play a key
role in the distribution of zAssets;

- Privacy Miners who stake zAssets to provide liquidity to the Panther Pools, and pay
relayer node fees;

- Users that hold zAssets and carry out transactions on any peerchain with a Panther
Pool and Vault;

- The Panther Foundation responsible for steering Panther to full decentralization and
encouraging community growth;

- Panther Tokenholders who vote on governance decisions and fund proposals through
the Panther DAO; and

- Community members who make proposals to improve the Panther ecosystem and are
involved in many ways but are not specifically invested in any single function of
Panther.

###Minting and Burning
Minting (creating) and burning (destroying) zAssets is a process handled by peerchain
self-custodial smart contracts, known as a Panther Vault. The process of doing this however,
is initiated by Gatekeepers responsible for providing collateral to Panther Vaults, and who act
as the elected custodians. zAssets are minted and burned at a 1:1 ratio to ensure assets are
always backed by the same amount of collateral. e.g 1USDT = 1zUSDT.

###Verification
Users and enterprises wishing to buy newly minted zAssets, or redeem zAssets bought on
secondary markets for the underlying collateral, are required to complete KYC/KYB (Know
Your Customer/Business) verification through a Gatekeeper.

###Transacting with zAssets
zAssets minted on a peerchain inherit all of the core properties of that peerchainâ€™s native
assets and can interact with DeFi ecosystems with the added benefit of onchain privacy.

###Panther Technology
There are seven technology components which make it possible for Panther deployments to
provide obfuscation of transactions in peerchain DeFi ecosystems, which we cover in the following pages.
