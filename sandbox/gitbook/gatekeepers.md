##Gatekeepers

Gatekeepers are a federation of globally distributed and independent financial institutions and
enterprises responsible for minting and burning zAssets. Additionally, Gatekeepers play the
important role verifying and maintaining regulatory compliance for Users wishing to buy or
sell zAssets. Panther will launch with a minimum of 3 Gatekeepers at launch.

Due to their capabilities, privacy-preserving blockchain-based projects can find themselves
facing scrutiny. It is anticipated that questions regarding the regulatory intricacies of
Panther’s privacy protocol might arise and are worth addressing at the outset. Panther does
not keep lists, maps, registers or documents on Panther Users, is unable to ascertain the
parties to a transaction, does not impose restriction on Users transacting with zAssets, and
does not take responsibility for the adherence of Gatekeepers to their local regulations and
licensing requirements. The protocol does, however, enable onchain publishing of zero
knowledge proofs to IPFS (Benet) that associate a given wallet address with a verified User.

That proof directs the querying party to the Gatekeeper responsible for processing the Panther
User at the time they bought newly minted zAssets or sold existing zAssets to redeem the
underlying collateral.

There will be transparency between Gatekeepers and aggregated statistics provided on the
network in a dashboard, which include:

- Names and corporate details of the current Gatekeepers;
- Mint and burn statistics;
- Panther Vault balances; and
- Number of verified Users per Gatekeeper.

Given the outsized value that transactional privacy provides to society, we believe that
Panther Protocol’s approach is both forward-thinking in its approach to regulatory
compliance and also in line with the industry’s best practices.
