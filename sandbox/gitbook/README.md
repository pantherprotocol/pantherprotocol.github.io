##About Panther Protocol

Panther is an interoperable, decentralised custodian and smart contract platform that enables
privacy of digital assets on peer blockchains (“peerchains”). At the core of Panther’s design
are Panther Pools, on-demand dark pools for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) which enable
institutional and retail Users to securely store, obfuscate and transact compliantly on
peerchains using Panther Assets (“zAssets''). zAssets are created by issuing 1:1 collateralized,
zero knowledge digital tokens on peerchains.

As Panther is built and the ecosystem scales, it is likely we will see zAssets proliferate across
peerchains with trading pairs for zAssets of most types. The added value that this obfuscation
brings to investors and Users will carry a premium. Panther’s design objective is to create a
liquid decentralized marketplace for privacy as a common good to enable onchain
transactional anonymity in a regulatory compliant fashion.
