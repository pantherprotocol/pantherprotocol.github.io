## Panther Token

The Panther Token is a finite supply, privacy-preserving gas token used to pay for fees within
the Panther ecosystem that also represents a right to vote on governance issues. It is used in
several instances to support the function of the protocol and provide incentives for its growth
and maintenance. zAssets are designed to improve usability and privacy through enforcement
of correct User behavior at the protocol level. The token has the following functions:

###Phase 1 Utility

In the first phase, the Panther Token will work in the following ways:

- the Panther Token is used to pay for mint and burn fees associated with zAssets
managed by Panther Vaults;
- the Panther Token is used to pay transaction fees for sending zAssets;
- the Panther Token is used to pay incentive fees to Privacy Miners;
- the Panther Token is used to pay privacy minerâ€™s relayer service fees;
- the Panther Token is used to provide rewards to anyone staking zAssets in Panther
Pools, from a dedicated token allocation in the Panther DAO; and
- the Panther Token is staked and used to vote on governance matters, such as Panther
Improvement Proposals (PIPs), Gatekeeper federation membership and requirements,
privacy thresholds, community and education grants, and privacy miner rewards.

###Phase 2 Utility

When the Panther Protocol is developed, the Panther Token will work in the following
additional ways:

- the Panther Token is delegated to or staked directly by validators responsible for
securing the Panther Protocol and processing transactions on the native chain;
- the Panther Token is used to provide rewards to Privacy Miners from the Panther
DAO;
- the Panther Token is bonded by Privacy Miners proportionally to the value locked in
Panther Vaults; and
- Vault Maintenance fees are paid by zAsset holders to incentivize honest network
behavior.
