##Panther Pools 

Panther Pools allow Users to privately transact on any peerchain through the use of zAssets
issued on that peerchain. This is achieved by randomly shuffling zAssets of the sender, other
Users and Privacy Miners, to send an equivalent amount to the receiver anonymously.

Meanwhile, the underlying 1:1 collateral assets are custodied in Panther Vaults that form part
of the peerchain Panther deployment and can be redeemed at any time through Gatekeepers.
In order to provide a practical, scalable, and trustless cryptographic proving system, HALO
Zero Trust Step (Bowe et al.) for recursive proofs is used to eliminate reliance on a trusted
third party setup.
